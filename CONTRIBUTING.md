## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```

4. **Make your changes**
   Make the necessary changes to the codebase. Be sure to follow the project's coding conventions and maintain readability.

   git commit -m "Your detailed commit message"
   ```

6. **Push your changes**
   Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

7. **Create a pull request**
   Open a pull request (PR) from your fork's branch to the main repository. Provide a clear description of the changes and why they’re necessary.
